    <p>From humble beginnings as a method to method to preserve fish by <br>
    coating it in fermented rice, sushi has come a long way. Following an <br>
    explosive rise to popularity in the 60's after the spread of the legendary <br>
    <em>California Roll</em>, sushi has become a phenomenom wherever it <br>
    wasn't popular already. While many cultures have their take on raw fish <br>
    (see one of my favorite mexican dishes, ceviche), Japans take is all <br>
    its own with a sometimes refined exploration of the sweetness and tenderness <br>
    of fresh fish, to at others a shameless exercise in self indulgence. <br>
    these days, the sushi most of us are familiar with is what is called a maki <br>
    roll in Japan, generally some Nori seaweed, filled with rice and various toppings <br>
    and rolled into a convenient package. With easily accessible ingredients <br>
    in todays supermarkets, everyone can make this delicious and refreshing <br>
    dish at home. </p>
