    <p>A feijoada is a hearty stew made with black beans and several meats, <br>
        usually pork and beef, bacon and sausage. Considered Brazilâ€™s <br>
        national dish, it is popular with rich and poor alike and served <br>
        from the smallest local diners to the largest upscale beach hotels across <br>
        the country. It is served with several side dishes such as rice and fried collard greens. <br>
        Feijoadas were reportedly created by African slaves in Brazil during the sixteenth <br>
        century using leftover meats and relatively cheap ingredients like rice. However, <br>
        this origin is contested by historians who believe it was derived from traditional <br>
        Portuguese and French pork and bean dishes.</p>
